# Tetris
 Replicate of the original Tetris game made by Legendword.
 
 This game is based on pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Libraries used are jQuery and Bootstrap. The algorithm for determining the next shape is based on `Math.random()`, and does not compensate for the inconsistency of this method. Therefore, the chances of getting all the shapes may fluctuate, and you may get multiple shapes of the same type in a row.
